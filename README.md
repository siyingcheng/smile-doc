## Overview

The Smile Project is an e-commerce demo project designed to verify APIs and UI testing technology. The project is divided into separate front-end and back-end components, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the system.

# Github Projects

To ensure efficient management of the project, we will use GitHub Projects to track the progress of design, development, testing, and deployment. This will allow for better communication and collaboration among team members, as well as easy access to all project documents and resources in one place.
